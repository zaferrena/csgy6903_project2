# csgy6903_project2

Project by Gavin Senger and Zachary Ferrena.

- Start by installing the cryptography library for python (with command [pip install cryptography])

- Using an account that does not have 2 factor authentication enabled, under your Google security settings, turn on less secure apps setting
  - (Manage your Google Account > Security > Less Secure App Access - Turn On)

- You should replace the username/password with an email and password connected to gmail.

- The used email should NOT BE from nyu.edu due to having 2 factor authentication on an NYU gamil address.

- Run both programs starting with server.py, then client.py when the server reaches the connnecting step. This can be done from the same computer using two different terminals or from two different computers.

- Wait for the program to run entirely and make sure both sides finish before temrinating a connection (i.e. killing either program). The client side should end before the server side.

- Occasionally an email may send without a body, this means that the program should be rerun.
